### Project Description
The Useless home application is a quirky, interactive setup where devices humorously react to their surroundings, creating a comically pointless yet entertaining display.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In an age of smart technology, there is a lack of whimsical, humorous home solutions that prioritize absurdity and playfulness, leaving a void for creativity and laughter in everyday life.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Unsmart home, a comically absurd home system that features quirky, non-functional devices designed solely to entertain, provoke laughter, and encourage playful interactions with technology.
